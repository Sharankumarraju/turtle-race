# Turtle Race Game (Python)
- A fun race simulation game built using Python’s **turtle module**.  
- This project is part of the **100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** (Day 19 Project).  
- It demonstrates how to use the `turtle` library, loops, and user interaction with simple graphics.  

# Overview
- This is a simple **Turtle Race game** where multiple turtles race across the screen.  
- The user is asked to **place a bet** on which colored turtle will win.  
- Each turtle moves forward by a random distance until one of them crosses the finish line.  
- The program then declares whether the user has won or lost.  

# Features
- 6 colorful turtles with unique starting positions.  
- Randomized movement to make each race different.  
- Interactive betting system.  
- Fun beginner project to learn about Python’s turtle graphics.  

# License
- This project is completely free and open-source.  
- Anyone can modify and use it without any restrictions!
